## Problem Definition

My client owns **Smile**, a small mental health clinic, where he manages a team of nurses, doctors, and secretaries who have to handle patient data every day. The clinic uses several software programs to manage patient records, appointments, and billing, all requiring some log in and, therefore, passwords. In the past, employees of the clinic have experienced a high workload which compromised the information and patient records of the clinic. Due to this, the employees have started using methods such as writing passwords on sticky notes, saving them in text files, notes on their phones, or even just telling each other, hoping one of them will memorize it. These actions caused a serious security concern, as they left the clinic vulnerable to data breaches and unauthorized access to patient data. This situation has been noticed by the patients, who are extremely concerned if their information will be accessed by people outside the workers, the trust in the clinic and its employees has decreased. The owner, scared by this situation, has approached me to design a tool to address both basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and the password management problems faced by the clinic employees. 

## Proposed Solution
The password manager will securely store and retrieve passwords, allowing staff to safely access the clinicâ€™s digital systems without compromising sensitive information. This solution aims to enhance both the productivity and security of the clinic, providing staff with an easy way to manage passwords without reverting to insecure practices.

## Success Criteria
1. The calculator should accept user input to perform basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
1. The calculator can handle typical errors (e.g., division by zero) and give appropriate feedback.
1. If the user enters the secret code ("open123"), the program will change modes and act as a password manager.
1. In password manager mode, the user should be able to perform CRUD operations (Create, Replace, Update, Delete):
   * Add a password (for example, for a website).
   * View the stored passwords (only if they re-enter the secret code).
1. Save passwords permanently and securely
1. Use the terminal to interact with the user.
